1998-08-17  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Update version to 0.3

	* Create an IDLF_COMBINE_REOPENED_MODULES to have libIDL combine
	  all the module declarations into one tree, instead of separate
	  trees with the same ident node.

	* Add __declspec support.  First one implemented is for
	  interfaces, so that __declspec (nostubs) interface foo { ... };
	  won't generate tree node information.  Had to revamp grammar
	  slightly to get a single lookahead.

	* Change IDL_long_t to IDL_longlong_t (+ unsigned version).

1998-08-10  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: Catch the interface Object construct, which isn't
	  legal, but is in some pseudo-IDL files.

	* lexer.l: Bring back Object token recognition.

	* ns.c (IDL_ns_ident_to_qstring): If given and IDLN_IDENT,
	  quietly call IDL_IDENT_TO_NS.

	* util.[ch]: Change g_strcase_hash to IDL_strcase_hash (make
	  public).  Add IDL_strcase_equal, IDL_strcase_cmp,
	  load_forward_dcls, resolve_forward_dcls,
	  print_unresolved_forward_dcls, IDL_tree_resolve_forward_dcls.
	  (IDL_parse_filename): Warn on unresolved forward declarations in
	  post-parse semantic checking.  Remove __IDL_tree_print, add
	  IDL_tree_walk_pre_order.

	* IDL.h: Add IDL_tree_walk_pre_order prototype and callback typedef.

1998-08-09  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: enum_type: Don't generate a nested scope.

1998-08-06  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Allow for redefinition of certain items in inheritance
	  (doesn't detect some invalid items, but still better than
	  before).
	
	* Change the namespace data structure from a general tree using a
	  linked list to case-insensitive string hashes for each tree
	  level.  Used g_str_hash from glib modified for
	  case-insensitivity (g_strcase_hash).

	* Fix bug where some top-level redeclarations would cause a core
	  dump.

	* Change references to strdup to g_strdup, and update
	  configure.in.
	
	* Begin major cutting for libIDL 0.3, which will have new
	  namespace code.  Move lots of stuff around.

1998-08-05  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* lexer.l: Change C-language warning level to warning level 2,
	  all other warnings to level 1
	
	* parser.y (yywarning*): Add multiple warning levels

	* IDL.h: Remove IDL_WARNING, add IDL_WARNING1-3 and IDL_WARNINGMAX
	
	* IDL.h: Generate a CPP error if glib.h isn't included beforehand.
	
	* IDL.h, parser.y: Integrate Sebastian Wilhelm's patch to add type
	  cast checking, with a number of style modifications of my own
	  (anything I broke is my fault ;-) for libIDL and add a warning
	  on casting a NULL pointer.

	* lexer.l: Implement Dick's suggestion to warn or error on
	  underscores in identifiers with underscores or ones which begin
	  with an underscore.
	
1998-08-04  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Preliminary inheritance checks

	* Implement pragmas for prefix, ID and version
	
	* First cut at Repository ID generation

1998-08-03  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: Add many new error messages.

1998-07-28  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* acinclude.m4 (revive): Create AC_CPP_ACCEPT_IDL and
	AC_CPP_PIPE_STDIN tests

	* configure.in: Add AC_CPP_ACCEPT_IDL and AC_CPP_PIPE_STDIN in
	configuration

	* util.h, parser.y, lexer.l: If HAVE_CPP_PIPE_STDIN is defined,
	then compile for piped CPP input, else use the more portable
	symlink method.  Also use getcwd instead of g_getcwd, since it has
	been commented out in glib.

1998-07-27  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y (IDL_parse_filename): g_getcwd returns a static buffer

1998-07-25  Neil Vachharajani  <nvachhar@pluto.njcc.com>

	* parser.y: Add one more byte for / in the allocation of linkto in 
	IDL_parse_filename
	
1998-07-20  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Most of inhertance is done.  ChangeLog won't be updated much now
	  in preference to CVS logs.

1998-07-01  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Fix spelling of "inheritance" :)
	
	* Add use long long type if __GNUC__ defined

	* Fix scoping rules (scope idents weren't being referenced
	  properly)

1998-06-29  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Create skeleton texinfo file

	* configure.in improved
	
	* Wee, should now also work with standard lex with new renaming
	  rule
	
	* Now works with standard yacc, but flex will be a requirement

1998-06-24  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Warn if identifier appears in different case
	
	* Most namespace collision detection added, except for inheritance

	* Use YYDEBUG
	
	* parser.y: Initial implementation of IDL_ns* stuff

1998-06-23  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Implement constant evaluation

	* Almost all tree generation stuff added

	* Implement const_dcl and const_exp

	* Implement type_dcl, interface and module non-terminals
	
1998-06-22  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Start implementing tree generation code

	* Add IDL_root_free, IDL_symtab_free

	* Modify IDL_parse_filename to include callbacks,
	  return a symbol table

	* Implmenent warning/error callback functionality

	* Move idl.c code to parser.y, delete idl.c
