1998-10-09  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: (positive_int_const) Improve errors and warnings for
	nonsensical values.

1998-10-08  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* IDL.h (IDLF_NO_EVAL_CONST): New flag, obsoletes IDLF_EVAL_CONST,
	which has been removed.  The default behavior is now to evaluate
	constant expressions.

	* IDL.h, parser.y (IDL_resolve_const_exp): New function.
	positive_int_const changed to attempt resolution of expression to
	an integral value.  primary_expr will attempt resolution of scoped
	names, so constant evaluation is now much improved.  An
	IDL_NODE_IS_LITERAL is also now in IDL.h.

Thu Aug 27 10:52:41 1998  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Update version to 0.5.0.

	* Updates to libIDL.texi, and renable in Makefile.am.

	* Integrate default maximum warning level into IDL_parse_filename.

Thu Aug 27 03:30:44 1998  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: Generate error if one tries to inherit from the same
	interface more than once.  Also use IDL_ns_ident_to_qstring to
	give more concise identifiers in error messages.

Thu Aug 27 01:08:56 1998  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* IDL.h: Removed IDL_TRUE and IDL_FALSE, so we can just use the
	  glib TRUE and FALSE.  References switched...

	* util.c (IDL_tree_walk_in_order): (...pre_order changed to the
	more accurate ...in_order).  Behavior change, return value is now
	void, and returning TRUE from the IDL_tree_func means traverse
	this node, and FALSE means don't traverse this node, instead of
	the previous return FALSE and stop traversal all together.  This
	is much more useful for this context, I think.

Wed Aug 26 01:48:12 1998  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* util.c (IDL_tree_process_forward_dcls),
		(IDL_tree_remove_inhibits),
		(IDL_tree_remove_empty_modules): Remove debugging messages.

	* util.c (IDL_parse_filename): Only run optimization if tree is
	  non-NULL, and improve useless file message.

	* parser.y: Complete previous declaration context error messages.

1998-08-25  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Update libIDL version to 0.4.0.
	
	* Update font lock keywords in README, added support for
	  __declspec.
	
	* Implementation of IDL_tree_free for IDLN_GENTREE hashes in
	  place.

	* Makefile.am: Change libtool version to 3:2:3.
	
	* parser.y, IDL.h: Changes for global ref counting.
	
	* util.c (IDL_tree_free): Instead of ref counting only IDENTS,
	  ref count all nodes instead (updated __IDL_tree_free, added
	  IDL_tree_free_real).  Update remove_list_node to reflect this
	  change.

	* util.h: Remove __IDL_tree_free.

	* util.c (__IDL_tree_free): Ref count IDLN_IDENTS.

Tue Aug 25 01:46:10 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* util.c (IDL_strcase_equal): Use g_strcasecmp.
	(IDL_strcase_cmp): Likewise.

1998-08-24  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Save inhibited nodes and free upon IDL_ns_free so that the full
	trees are available to traverse from the namespace.
	 
	* 'nostubs' changed to 'inhibit'

1998-08-17  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Update version to 0.3

	* Create an IDLF_COMBINE_REOPENED_MODULES to have libIDL combine
	  all the module declarations into one tree, instead of separate
	  trees with the same ident node.

	* Add __declspec support.  First one implemented is for
	  interfaces, so that __declspec (nostubs) interface foo { ... };
	  won't generate tree node information.  Had to revamp grammar
	  slightly to get a single lookahead.

	* Change IDL_long_t to IDL_longlong_t (+ unsigned version).

1998-08-10  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: Catch the interface Object construct, which isn't
	  legal, but is in some pseudo-IDL files.

	* lexer.l: Bring back Object token recognition.

	* ns.c (IDL_ns_ident_to_qstring): If given and IDLN_IDENT,
	  quietly call IDL_IDENT_TO_NS.

	* util.[ch]: Change g_strcase_hash to IDL_strcase_hash (make
	  public).  Add IDL_strcase_equal, IDL_strcase_cmp,
	  load_forward_dcls, resolve_forward_dcls,
	  print_unresolved_forward_dcls, IDL_tree_resolve_forward_dcls.
	  (IDL_parse_filename): Warn on unresolved forward declarations in
	  post-parse semantic checking.  Remove __IDL_tree_print, add
	  IDL_tree_walk_pre_order.

	* IDL.h: Add IDL_tree_walk_pre_order prototype and callback typedef.

1998-08-09  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: enum_type: Don't generate a nested scope.

1998-08-06  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Allow for redefinition of certain items in inheritance
	  (doesn't detect some invalid items, but still better than
	  before).
	
	* Change the namespace data structure from a general tree using a
	  linked list to case-insensitive string hashes for each tree
	  level.  Used g_str_hash from glib modified for
	  case-insensitivity (g_strcase_hash).

	* Fix bug where some top-level redeclarations would cause a core
	  dump.

	* Change references to strdup to g_strdup, and update
	  configure.in.
	
	* Begin major cutting for libIDL 0.3, which will have new
	  namespace code.  Move lots of stuff around.

1998-08-05  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* lexer.l: Change C-language warning level to warning level 2,
	  all other warnings to level 1
	
	* parser.y (yywarning*): Add multiple warning levels

	* IDL.h: Remove IDL_WARNING, add IDL_WARNING1-3 and IDL_WARNINGMAX
	
	* IDL.h: Generate a CPP error if glib.h isn't included beforehand.
	
	* IDL.h, parser.y: Integrate Sebastian Wilhelm's patch to add type
	  cast checking, with a number of style modifications of my own
	  (anything I broke is my fault ;-) for libIDL and add a warning
	  on casting a NULL pointer.

	* lexer.l: Implement Dick's suggestion to warn or error on
	  underscores in identifiers with underscores or ones which begin
	  with an underscore.
	
1998-08-04  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Preliminary inheritance checks

	* Implement pragmas for prefix, ID and version
	
	* First cut at Repository ID generation

1998-08-03  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y: Add many new error messages.

1998-07-28  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* acinclude.m4 (revive): Create AC_CPP_ACCEPT_IDL and
	AC_CPP_PIPE_STDIN tests

	* configure.in: Add AC_CPP_ACCEPT_IDL and AC_CPP_PIPE_STDIN in
	configuration

	* util.h, parser.y, lexer.l: If HAVE_CPP_PIPE_STDIN is defined,
	then compile for piped CPP input, else use the more portable
	symlink method.  Also use getcwd instead of g_getcwd, since it has
	been commented out in glib.

1998-07-27  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* parser.y (IDL_parse_filename): g_getcwd returns a static buffer

1998-07-25  Neil Vachharajani  <nvachhar@pluto.njcc.com>

	* parser.y: Add one more byte for / in the allocation of linkto in 
	IDL_parse_filename
	
1998-07-20  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Most of inhertance is done.  ChangeLog won't be updated much now
	  in preference to CVS logs.

1998-07-01  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Fix spelling of "inheritance" :)
	
	* Add use long long type if __GNUC__ defined

	* Fix scoping rules (scope idents weren't being referenced
	  properly)

1998-06-29  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Create skeleton texinfo file

	* configure.in improved
	
	* Wee, should now also work with standard lex with new renaming
	  rule
	
	* Now works with standard yacc, but flex will be a requirement

1998-06-24  Andrew Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* Warn if identifier appears in different case
	
	* Most namespace collision detection added, except for inheritance
